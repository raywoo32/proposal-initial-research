## Key Ideas: 
- Intentions VS Implementations, people can meet their goals more easily when an "implementation intentions" is met. Basically SMART goals
- Deminishing bad behaviours is harder than replacing behaviours 

## Relevence to my own research: 
- The concept of implementaiton intention 
- Replacing behaviours as more powerful than deminishing bad behaviours

## Personal comments 
- Concept similar to my ADHD coaching
- SMART goals, blockers, etc. 

## Limitations
- Small power
- Food as a topic is not nessecarily extensible 
- Human memory and reporting 
- Does type of implementation intention matter?

## Priority:
- low
