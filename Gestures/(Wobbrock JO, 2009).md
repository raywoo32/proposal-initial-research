## Key Ideas: 
- First elicitation study?
- Good reference for the ideas of gestures in general, historical perspective 

## Relevence to my own research: 
- GESTURES! REFERENCES! 
- 7 point likert scale concerning gesture goodness and ease 
- Form (does the hand move and how does it move), Nature (is it symbolic, physical, metaphorical, abstract), Binding (it is object centric, world dependent, mixed), Flow (descrete or continuous) 
- "two participants who regularly used 1 finger touces felt the system needed o distinguish among fingers" Eg. ring finegr as different form pointer ect. (AR app?)
- People like to learn from "extending" previously known interfaces
- Interacting with the world outside the interface is a type of interaction 
- Refernents beyond a certain point (fig 2.) could benifit also from having a widget
- People treated corners and boundaries as special 

## Personal comments 
- Someone applied imaginary glue for cut and paste <3333

## Limitations
- tabletop so conclusions are not directly applicable 

## Priority:
- High
