## From the SPHHS Student Handbook 

- Page limit == 10-12 pates excluding title page, abstract, work plan, references 

### Format
- An introductory chapter(s) that outlines the problem context for the work, establishes its purpose and objectives, provides a review of literature, and explains how the manuscripts presented in the body address the purpose and objectives.
- Normally, a chapter that introduces and explains the methodology followed in the thesis. 
- Manuscripts that present research findings/contributions
- For a PhD Candidate, these must be at least three for which the student is first author and possibly others for which the student is not first author
- For a MSc Candidate, this must be at least one for which the student is first author. Typically, these will be manuscripts for refereed journals, but other formats, such as book chapters, may be appropriate. The manuscripts may be published, submitted for publication, or in publishable form (i.e. formatted for a potential publication venue) in peer reviewed outlets of sufficient caliber, as deemed by the thesis committee. 
- A concluding chapter that outlines the principal findings and contributions of the manuscripts to the total research effort.
- References cited in each manuscript, and in the introductory and concluding chapters, are normally consolidated at the end of the thesis.
- Appendixes may also be included as part of the thesis. •The entire thesis must be formatted according to the GSAP’s requirements for manuscript-based theses: https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-postdoctoral-affairs/current-students/thesis-preparationMaster’s Thesis For the Master’s thesis, an approved topic is required and both the thesis proposal and final thesis will be defended in oral examinations. 
- The M.Sc. thesis committee consists of a minimum of threefaculty members and includes: the student's thesis supervisor and at least one other member of the School of Public Health and Health System’s faculty. One committee member may be from outside the School. If a committee member does not have a regular appointment with the University of Waterloo, they will need to have an Adjunct appointment with SPHHS to serve on a thesis committee. The composition of the Thesis Advisory Committee must be approved by the SPHHS Graduate Studies Committee prior to submitting notification of the M.Sc. Proposal

### Thesis Commitee 
- Page limit for the proposal itself, excluding the title page, abstract, work plan, and references, is 10-12 full pages (normally single spaced, size 12 font, normal margins).
- You may add an Appendix with additional tables, figures or details.
- Sections Page with project title and abstract
- Abstract maximum 250 words
- Use these or equivalent headers: Background, Research Questions, Methods, and Contribution (or Significance or Expected Outcomes)

Your thesis committee will consider the following:
1.Is the background about the research problem, its context, and gaps in knowledge clear and appropriately elaborated? Is the importance of the research problem clearly described?
2.Is the research purpose clear and persuasively described? Is the relevance of the research convincingly explained?
3.Does appropriate prior research inform the study and are key references from peer-reviewed literature cited? 
4.Are the research questions or specific aims/objectives well defined, appropriate, and clearly stated? If the study questions/aims can be articulated as hypotheses, are hypotheses included and appropriate?
5.Is a theoretical perspective used, and if so, is it adequately described and appropriate for the research purpose and question(s)?
6.Is the type of research design clearly stated? Is it appropriate to answer the research question(s)? Is it adequately and appropriately explained?
7.Are the methods appropriate to meet the objectives? Is the methods section sufficiently detailed? For instance, is the sampling plan appropriate and clearly described? Are procedures and the analysis plan explained and appropriate?
8.Does the project appear to meet expectations of other relevant parties, including the Office of Research Ethics, and any other relevant bodies for your research, such as partner organizations funding the research?
9.Is the combination of elements of the proposal, from the statement of the problem on through to methods, coherent? Do the pieces make sense and work together in terms of design and methodology?
10.Are the main limitations considered and ways to mitigate these limitations explained?
11.Is the proposed schedule of tasks described in a clear, feasible workplan or timeline?
12.Is the writing grammatically correct, free of typos, well organized, and clear?
13.Is the reference format a standard one, and is it used consistently and correctly?

#### Background 
- Include a statement of the problem. Provide context about the problem, who it affects, its importance, and the need/gap that needs to be filled. 
- Cite key literature. 
- If appropriate for your thesis, introduce your theoretical/ conceptual lens.
- Include a statement of the purpose of your thesis (e.g., “The overall goal of this thesis is to...”). 
- Provide the justification or rationale that underlies your thesis’s purpose. 
- Specific Aims Include a statement that begins: “The proposed research question[s] is: .....?” or “Thisthesis asks the question: ....?” or "The specific aims of the thesis are..." 
- This section may (optionally) include two "layers" with the bottom layer to include, if appropriate, hypotheses or sub-questions.

#### Methods
- You may find it helpful to link particular methods to specific aims or objectives.
- It is helpful in this section to use some sub-headers. 
- The following are a suggestion and may not fit every research study. If your thesis includes several studies, you may wish to replicate these headers for each study e.g, describe the design, data sources/procedures, etc. for Study 1, and then describe these things for Study 2, etc).
- Research design and approach. Label the type of research design. 
- Link it to elements in your methods.
- Theoretical orientation [Optional; this might go in the Background or, for some kinds of qualitative studies, in its own section / with its own header.]
- Study site (setting), 
- study population
- sample, Include sampling plan, sample size, and recruitment
- Data sources and procedures. Mention collection instruments/ guides if appropriate for your study. 
- If appropriate, describe independent and dependent variables and measures. 

#### Analysis: 
- plan Limitations and Mitigation Strategies to outline the main limitations of your proposed methods
- What can you do to help mitigate the impacts of these limitations on your results/conclusions.

#### Contribution:
- (or Significance or Expected outcomes): 
- What kind of a difference your work may make and to whom

#### References
- Begin the references on a separate page.
- Use a standard reference format that is appropriate in your field.

#### Workplan and Timeline
- Map out the main elements and timeline expected for each element. 
- This should not exceed one page. 
- Your work plan/timeline is normally presented as a figure, graphic, or table.
