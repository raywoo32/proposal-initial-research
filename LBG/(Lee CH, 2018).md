## Key Ideas: 
- What drives "stickiness" in LBG
- Taiwan pokemon go 
- stickiness is linked to willingness to pay money 
- user participation had a harsh drop off 
- mobile "social" games and games based on movie characters are on the rise 
- importance of feeling "flow" (need to foster concentration and time distortion) 
- sense of challenge, foster curiosity, percieved control (particularly relevent for LBG), percieved accuracy, perceived currency, perceived responsiveness
- framework for this is complicated and well defined but general ideas make sense 
- telepresence is important as is catching a users attention, you do not need skill or age to participate 
- pookemon go was more addictive to male player age and platform also had an effect 
- this paper hypthesized that women were satisfied not catching them all because pokemon are cute and you can dress up your avatar??? 
- ios better
- mid 20s better, nostalgia?
