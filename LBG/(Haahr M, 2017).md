## Key Ideas: 
- Cultural heritage, ar, workshop, lbg
- The concept of presence in the surrondings and the tension between immersion in game and physical presence 
- feeling or identifying as the game character! 
- The fantasy elements of the game workld (the pokemon) are all in the "fake world" the cohesion isn't that good
- Lots of LBG have no "plot", their game choice has branching desicion points 

## Relevence to my own research: 
- LBG!!!! 
- Good for general design ideas 
- terratorial mechanism (control physical territory) 
- resource gathering (move) 
- Collection, leving and trainign 

## Personal comments 
- Very interesting, has a lot of "design concepts" explained well

## Limitations
- I obviously can't play the games since they are location specific. 
- I think this applies to a "waterloo" specific game 

## Priority:
- medium, I will come back to it for design thinking 

## Papers found from this paper to read 
- Examples of LBG:  13, 2, 4, 12, 7, 14

## Categories:
