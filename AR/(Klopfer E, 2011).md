## Key Ideas: 
- Timelab: a game to educate about climate change policy, mandates collaberation, you only get half the information. Designed to be done in pairs, make the connection to policy and gov
- tension between easily moved games and games based on one location: games tied to one location are more personal but less accessible
- Made drag and drop AR making tool 
- Have players create games to resolve above tension: like geocashing lol 
- Use ar to link real life, and game life to consequences in real life 
- Have branching stories, not linear stories 
- AR games connected to specific location related societal issues.
