## Key Ideas: 
- a design framework for conceptual handheld ar games
- components: AR library, graphics and multimedia functionalities, network supporm game application framework 
- Graphics and multimedis: 2d/3d scene rendering, sound engine, sensor reading, multi-touch support (game engine basically), GPS, accellerometer, cameria, compass, interactive projections, near field commication tech
- Network Communicatoin: wifi, bluetooth, peer to peer, gps, cloud computing, social media
- game application framework: eg. invisible train  --> Honestly dont get it 
- Seamful design: mobility 
- lighting can disrupt gameplay
- use game mechanics that work with the limits of your tech 
- handheld == small screen size 
- 3 levels of design: system level, interaction level, application level 

## Relevence to my own research: 
-  they state concern over mobile and network connectivity --> 5G?
- Design guide
- 

## Personal comments 
-You should reread it to absorb more design concepts 

## Limitations
- from 2011 
- application level includes: education, contextual, social interaction (many other categories?)

## Priority:
- medium high

## Papers found from this paper to read 
- 13 (invisible train ar game) 

## Categories: 
- AR, design guide
