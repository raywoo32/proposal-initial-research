## Key Ideas: 
- ideas of "toward next gen-mobile ar games"
- small, player created games
- emphasizes integration with platforms users already have 

## Relevence to my own research: 
- People felt more engaged with "virtual elements" than real ones
- Had interesting software but it is 2008 so idk if they are still supported! 

## Personal comments 
- Isn't social media with location features already ar" Lots of social media already has elements in AR, a coffee shop might have obvious IG bait. Businesses already want digital and physical presence together (check ins on fb), location tagging on ig
- Can you use existing (and thus already adopted platforms) as a basis for gameplay? Would have to be riddle based? idk. 
- Isn't geocashing a "primitive" ar game

## Limitations
- This paper is from 2008 so lots of this has happened 
- The citation style annoys me so much

## Priority:
- Medium, great for a historical perspective. 

## Papers found from this paper to read 
- 4: scale of ar to vr (pg 41)
- 1: AR quake, one of the first ar games (pg 43) 

## Categories: 
- AR, LBG (kinda), mobile
