## From SPHHS Manual 

Once you and your supervisor agree that the written proposal is ready for presentation, there are a number of steps you must follow: 

1. The student must contact all members of the committee to determine possible dates and times for the presentation.
2. The student must book a room for a two-hour period and inform all committee members of the date, time and room booking. The AHS Receptionist (ahsreception@uwaterloo.ca) can assist with room bookings. Any necessary A-V equipment must be booked in advance as well.
3. The student must complete the “M.Sc. Thesis Proposal- Notification Form” (Available on LEARN in SPHHS Research Grad Community Group Content Forms) and submit it to the Graduate Coordinator, M.Sc. & Ph.D. Programs or Graduate Research Assistant at minimum three weeks in advance of the proposal.  Note: the information provided in the Thesis Proposal- Notification Form will be used to draft the email announcement and the thesis proposal paperwork.  
4. The student must provide each member of the committee, as well as the Graduate Coordinator, with a copy of the proposal, at least three weeks in advance of the presentation. The student should ask the committee members and the Graduate Coordinator if an electronic copy is sufficient
