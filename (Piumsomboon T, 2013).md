## Key Ideas: 
- AR! User defined gestures! 
- gestures should be reuseable and reversible (when possible)
- Size of gesture matters (ie. you can use 2 fingers or 2 hands to enlarge somehting) 
- user defined set on pg 13
- use metaphors from existing ui 
- Symbolic gestures make sense but "box selection" does not, is it an arbitrary task?
- Unsure to show or not show your hands in AR, might make it more difficult to see? (MAKE THEM TRANSLUCENT) 
- no consensus on menu type (horizontal, vertical, object based) 
- Uniform scaling is not obvious
- Many hand poses can be used for the same gesture (even across the same participant) 
- their AR doesn't have haptic feedback 
- Boxes and motifs should have clear selsctors 

## Relevence to my own research: 
- How can we build upon this now? 
- METHODOLOGY! and contributions (user defined gestures, gesture classification, agreement scores, qualitiative findings, implications!) 
- vision tracking adds to depth of "gestures" possible
- What tasks are important (They ref 3,5,6,12,19)
- Average participant size is around 20 for gesture elucidation  
- natural feature recognition libraries for recording info! 
- Taxonomy for gestures in AR

## Personal comments 
- REREAD THE IMPICATIONS SECTION after looking at other papers that cite this paper 
- wizard of oz study is an interesting concept! 

## Limitations
- This is not really assuming movement of the person in space, ie. a location based game 
- 

## Priority:
- High! 

## Papers found from this paper to read 
- 1 (ar), 2,3 (AR and speech and hand gestures), 5 (handy AR), 13 (hand gestures interfaces in ar markerless tracking), 12 (haptics and ar) 
- 14 (SenseShapes), 15 (wizard of oz study)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_of_Oz_experiment] 
- 3 (IMPORTANT mobile ar system), 16 (vision tracking and ar)
- 7,8 (kinect) 
- TODO: Look at papers citing this paper for other AR studies
